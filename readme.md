# Email Verification Tool

![Project Demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Introduction

The Email Verification Tool is a lightweight and efficient GoLang-based utility designed to validate email addresses. It checks for basic syntax correctness, domain validity, and DNS records to ensure that the provided email address is likely to be valid. This tool does not include SMTP verification.

## Features

- **Syntax Validation**: Ensures the email address adheres to standard email formatting rules.
- **Domain Check**: Verifies if the domain part of the email address has valid MX (Mail Exchange) records.
- **DNS Record Check**: Checks for the presence of TXT records, SPF, and DMARC records for domain verification.
